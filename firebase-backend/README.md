# Live Demo
[The Facebook Clone By Juan Villa](https://tfc-juanevillam.web.app/)

# Information
Every once in a while, a revolutionary product comes along that changes everything. Facebook's been very fortunate. It's been able to introduce a few of these into the world. But for me, I am not introducing a new revolutionary product to the World, I am going to copy one of those, and I call it **The Facebook Clone** :star:

On this app you can:
- Give likes and comments.
- Post photos, videos and stories.
- Change the Theme (Dark/Light Mode).

It's a mini clone of the Facebook web and app **(For educational purposes only)** 👨🏼‍🎓 

I will be continually developing this app, creating new features and improving the existing ones. I hope you enjoy it. Thank you.

# Documentation
**Note that all the requirements are free and easy to do. I will continue improving this docs.** 

**Don't forget you can write to ask me anything, [reach me here](https://github.com/juanevillam)**

1. Run `npm i` or `npm install` in order to get all the packages that The Facebook Clone needs.
2. [Create a Firebase Account](https://firebase.google.com/) so you can have a Firebase Project (we'll need it as our Database and Web Hosting).
3. [Create a Cloudinary Account](https://cloudinary.com/) so you can upload all the files (posts, videos, stories, audios) as .mp3 .mp4 .jpg files on the Internet (you can use [Firebase Storage](https://firebase.google.com/docs/storage) but I'm not currently using it for this project).
4. Put your Firebase Creadentials [here](https://github.com/juanevillam/facebook-clone/blob/main/src/Database/firebase.js).
5. Put your Cloudinary Crendentials [here](https://github.com/juanevillam/facebook-clone/blob/main/src/Helpers/handlePostFileToDatabase.jsx).
